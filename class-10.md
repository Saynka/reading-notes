debugging

to find the source of an error, it helps to know how scripts are processed, the order in which statements are executed can be complex some tasks cannot complete until another statement or function has been run

javascript interpreter processes one line of code at a time when a statment need data from another function, it stacks or piles the new fucntion on top of the current task

how to deal with errors
1-debug the script to fix errors
2-handle errors gracefully

debeguggin is the process of finding errors. it involves a process of deduction

the console helps narrow down the area in which the error is located, so you can try to find the exact error

if you know what you may get an error, use the try, catch, finally statements use them to give your users helpful feed back


you can place the debugger keyword within a conditional statemnt so that it onl triggers the breakpoint if the condition is met.

use breakpoints, go threw code line by line to find the error....

just like signal flow
