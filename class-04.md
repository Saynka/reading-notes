chapter 15. 
THIS is h ow to use css to make it more like your paint brush and i was actualyl lookingh for this online as i opened up to this...

Block-level elements start a new line and act as a main building block of any layout
< h1
  p
  ul
  li

if one block-level element sits inside another block-level element then the outer box is known as a containing or parent element

in-line elements 
< img
  b

relative positioning-move an element in a relation to whwere it would have been in normal flow
absolute positioning -the box is taken out of normal flow and no longer aff3ects the position opf the other elements
fixed positioning- is a type of absolute positioning that requires the position property to have a calue of fixed 
floating positioning-allows you to take an element in normal flow and place it as far to the left or right of the containing element as possible
