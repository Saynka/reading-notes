## Shortcuts

* Here's your first shortcut. When you enter commands, they are actually stored in a history. You can traverse this history using the up and down arrow keys. 
So don't bother re-typing out commands you have previously entered, you can usually just hit the up arrow a few times. 
You can also edit these commands using the left and right arrow keys to move the cursor where you want.
* If you run the command cd without any arguments then it will always take you back to your home directory.
* file [path] to figure out file stuffs its also case sensitve
