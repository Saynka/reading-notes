## Common Mistakes 

* if you have heard the saying “measure twice and cut once,” then you are probably familiar with the idea of spending upfront time to make sure something is done right, rather than diving right in.

* Read the problem completely twice.
* Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.
* Optimize the manual steps.
* Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
* Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.
* Optimize the real code.
* As much as 70% of our time should be spent in steps 1-3.

## Read the problem completely twice

* This is the single most important step.  You may even want to read the problem 3 or 4 times.

* You want to make sure you completely understand the problem.  A good test of this is whether or not you can explain the problem to someone else.

## Solve the Problem Manually

* Programming is automation plain and simple.  You may have the ability to skip the manual steps and jump directly to code, but there is a manual process which is the foundation of any code you write.

* It is very important to solve the problem manually first, so that you know what you are going to automate, otherwise you are just slinging code around.  Which while can be fun, will make you look like an idiot in a programming interview and will probably cause you to sweat profusely.
