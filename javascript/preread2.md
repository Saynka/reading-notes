## “Pretend your time is worth $1,000/hr. Would you spend five of them doing extra work for free? Would you waste one on being angry?” -Niklas Göke

* The truth is, most people value their time at far, far less than it’s worth.

* They say yes to things they have no business doing. They give away their talents, attention, and effort to others who take, take, take.

* They spend hours watching low-quality television and social media when they should be productive and effective.

* See, many people could be making a fortune (if they used their time well)…but instead, they give away their time in unproductive ways that leave them broke, unhappy, and stuck.

## “Busyness” Isn’t a Badge of Honor; It’s a Sign of Weakness

* Busyness and Stress Are the Enemy

* “Being busy is a form of mental laziness.” -Tim Ferriss

* You Can Do Amazing Things, But Only If You Have Time to Do Them

* “The difference between successful people and really successful people is that really successful people say no to almost everything.” -Warren Buffet

## In Conclusion

* “Living in frenzy is a sign we’ve squandered too much.” -Niklas Goke
In reality, a lot of people are living a frenzied, busy life. They wear their business as a badge of honor, and brag about their full schedules.
Frankly, most people prefer the little dopamine boost of checking boxes on a to-do list than actually getting important work done.
How do you value your time?
Take stock of the things you did this week. How many of them were worthy of $1,000/hour?
How many activities were a true waste of time?
Value your time at what it deserves to be. The higher the value, the more important and productive work you’ll do — and the less trivial and mindless tasks you’ll get caught in.
