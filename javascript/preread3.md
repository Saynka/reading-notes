# How to think like a programmer

* You probably also wondered what does it mean, exactly, to think like a programmer? And how do you do it??

* Essentially, it’s all about a more effective way for problem solving.

## Problem solving is the meta-skill.

* We all have problems. Big and small. How we deal with them is sometimes, well…pretty random.

* Unless you have a system, this is probably how you “solve” problems (which is what I did when I started coding):

* Try a solution.
* If that doesn’t work, try another one.
* If that doesn’t work, repeat step 2 until you luck out.
* Look, sometimes you luck out. But that is the worst way to solve problems! And it’s a huge, huge waste of time.

* The best way involves a) having a framework and b) practicing it.

* “The biggest mistake I see new programmers make is focusing on learning syntax instead of learning how to solve problems.”— V. Anton Spraul

## problem salving steps

### 1. understand

* Know exactly what is being asked. Most hard problems are hard because you don’t understand them (hence why this is the first step).

### 2. Plan

* Don’t dive right into solving without a plan (and somehow hope you can muddle your way through). Plan your solution!

### 3. Divide

* Do not try to solve one big problem. You will cry.

* Instead, break it into sub-problems. These sub-problems are much easier to solve.

* Then, solve each sub-problem one by one. Begin with the simplest. Simplest means you know the answer (or are closer to that answer).

### 4. Stuck?

* “The art of debugging is figuring out what you really told your program to do rather than what you thought you told it to do.”” — Andrew Singer
