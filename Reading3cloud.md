# Reading notes for terminal back and fourth shinangines 

so if i was expaling this to someone who has no idea whats going on i would say this has something to do with how cloud systesm work but in this case there is no automation.
you are pulling things back and forth to work on them and no auto saves. so dont forget to save (control-S) 

cd- change directory 
**git push origin master**
ls- list

git commit -m "what ever you want inbetween the quotes"
will put a label on the work you made from your terminal but not make a change to the actual repository in get hub...

editing in VScode will upload directly to your repository on github
