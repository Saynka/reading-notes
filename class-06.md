**Object literals**

METHOD - in an object, functions become known as methods

propertys- if a variable is part of an object it is called a property, the calue of a property can be a string, number, boolean, arrat or even another object the value of a method is always a function 

* litteral notation is the easiest and most popular way to create objects 
objects are inside curly braces 

sperate each key from its value using a colon,
seperate each property and method witha comma
(but not after the last value)

you access the properties or methods of an object using dot notation. you can also access properties using square brackets

DOT Notation-to access a propert or method of an object you use the name of the object, followed by  a period, then the name of the property or method you want to access

**Document Object Model**

Document Object Model- is neither a part of html nor part of JavaScript it is a separate set of rules it is implemented by all major browser makes and covers two primary areas

dom states what your script can ask the browser about the current page, and to tell the browser to update what is being shown to the user

attribute node-the openiong tags of html elements can carry attributes and these are represented bu attribute nodes in the dom tree

text nodes- once you have accessed an elemment node you can then reach the text within that element. this is stored in its own text node.


2 steps to dom tree 
1:locate the node that represent the elements you want to work with .
2: use its text content, child elements, and attributes.

when you say dom is working with and element, it is actually working with a node that represents that element.
