## reading notes 5 html css colortxt 

img - tag that tell html to look for image

src - tells the tag where to look

alt - is for giving some kind of txt hovering over a image that you cant see 

obviously where you place a image in code matter 

because of block line elements and inline elements

align left
thsi aligns the image to the left  allowing text on the right side 

align right
this aligns the image to the right allowing text on the left side

* image reshaping software might re relevent at some point *

obviously with images you dont want to use a small resolution picture and blow it up past its size

colors is a little bit more indepth 

hue 
is the colloquial idea of color

saturation 
is the amount of grey in a color "i did not know....."

lightness 
is the amount of white or black in a color

websites out there to help  you pic colors but css3 has it built into it and i have not yet ad truble finding the right colors for this basic stuff im sure this is just a artistic rabbit hole ones you start down here
