* Tables

tables represents information in a grid format
 basic table structure

TABLE-element is used to create a table. the contents of the table are written out row by row, it is also used to add tables to a web page

TR(table row)-you indicate the start of each row using the opening tr tag

TD(table data)-each cell of a table is represented using a td element

TH-(Table heading)-element is used just like the td element but its purpose is to represent the heading for either a column or a row

THREAD-  the headings of the table should sit inside the thread element

TBODY-the should should sit inside the tbody element

TFOOT-the footer belongs inside the tfoot element

what not to do! pg 137




* Functions, methods, and Objects

the new keyword and the object constructor create a blank object.
you can then add properties and methods to the object.

to create and empty object using literal notation use 
var whatever = {}
curley crackets create and empty object

object.propertyname = "property value"

to clear the value of a property you could set it to a blank string 

object constructors can use a function as a template for creating oobjects.
create a template with the objects properties and methods 

THIS- is used instead of the object name to indicate that the propery or method belongs to the object that this function creates...

INSTANCES- using the constructor funtion. the new keyword followed by a call to the function creates and object. the properties of each obect are giving as argument to the function

create the object, then add properties and methods
