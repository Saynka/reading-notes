// loop over cookies sold
// create an li
// grab an id for the store name 
// fill it with content
// append it to the dom

* "render"=makes things show up on dom

render: cookiestoage(){
//  grab an id for the store name
var jfllaksfj = document.kdfslfj("name ");


shows what you plug into it 
fjksldfjk.textContent = this.jfslfjl;



seattle.render()


// creating a LI list item

// fill it with content "temperate litteral"?

## Reading-notes

* CCS

ccs treats each html element as it is in its own box. this box will either be block-level box or inline box

block lvl elements-start on a new line
H1-p-ul-li

inline elements- flow inbetween surrounding text
img-b-i


if one block-level element sits inside another block lvl element then the outer box is known as the "containin" or "parent element"

RELATIVE POSITIONS-this move and element from the position it would be normal flow, shifitng it to top right bottom or left

ABSOLUTE POSITIONIN-this positions the element in relatiobn to itsconataining element

FIXED POSITIONG-this is a form of absolute positioning that positions the element in relation to the browser window as opposed to the containing element

FLOATING ELEMENTS-allows you to take the element out of normal flow and position it to the far left or right of a containing box the floated element becomes a block-level element around which other content can flow
