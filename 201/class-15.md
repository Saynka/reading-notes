# my thoughts on the team building discussion

i have worked in both of these enviroments and they need eachother. 
i dont understand peoples need to basically "show off their dick size"
stip away all the bull shit and what the context is... is basically monkeys proving they are better then this monkey that they dont like cuz he has blond hair. iv hated this behavior since i was a child. the idea of a group that dosent have this is also not realistic you cant just be layed back and care free. not every idea is good. not everyones opinions are relvent to the task at hand. now you dont need to be cruel in these things or put people down or make them question them selfs. Teams need to understand strengths and weekness across the membors people need to be held accountable for the things they do does not matter if right or wrong. if you are the weakest member of your team you are on the right team they are here to teach you something that you might not know you needed. 

what team would i rather be on? its hard to say iv been in kitchens where i was absolutly the fastest cook in the room. but did the dude next to me season the salsa better at a slower pace yes did he hold me accountable for food sitting out to long cuz he wasent reasdy to serve in the same out of time i was? yes. so whos really wrong in that its a whole philosophical debate

people who refuse to stop and look at them selfs and maybe think they need to do something different is litterly the reason the world is as fucked up as it is right now as of wrighting this. I refuse to contribute to that ideal.
