TRANSFORMS
The transform property comes in two different settings, two-dimensional and three-dimensional. Each of these come with their own individual properties and values.

* 2D Transforms
Elements may be distorted, or transformed, on both a two-dimensional plane or a three-dimensional plane. Two-dimensional transforms work on the x and y axes, known as horizontal and vertical axes. Three-dimensional transforms work on both the x and y axes, as well as the z axis. These three-dimensional transforms help define not only the length and width of an element, but also the depth. Weâ€™ll start by discussing how to transform elements on a two-dimensional plane, and then work our way into three-dimensional transforms.

* Transitions
transition to take place, an element must have a change in state, and different styles must be identified for each state. The easiest way for determining styles for different states is by using the :hover, :focus, :active, and :target pseudo-classes.
