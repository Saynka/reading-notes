# Express

## Put

### The PUT method is most often used to update an existing resource. If you want to update a specific resource (which comes with a specific URI), you can call the PUT method to that resource URI with the request body containing the complete new version of the resource you are trying to update.

## Patch

### The PATCH method is very similar to the PUT method because it also modifies an existing resource. The difference is that for the PUT method, the request body contains the complete new version, whereas for the PATCH method, the request body only needs to contain the specific changes to the resource, specifically a set of instructions describing how that resource should be changed, and the API service will create a new version according to that instruction.

## compare and contrrast Swagger, Api docs.js postman

### not sure on this yet i know that postman is really complicated to use and iv never been able to get it to work so i have no feelings for it right no

### swager looks promising and brian is gonna teach us how to use it so it will most likely be what i use

### apidocs.js is also the same i would rather learn how to use something from someone who knows how to use it the get no where like i did with post man

## Terms

### web server 

### The primary function of a web server is to store, process and deliver web pages to clients.[2] This citation was good a few decades ago but nowadays it is better to use the terms of Web contents and / or Web resources instead of Web Pages because the first ones cover all kind of contents that can be delivered to clients by web server. Examples of Web contents may be HTML files, XHTML files, image files, style sheets, scripts, other types of generic files that may be downloaded by clients, etc

### Routing

### Routing or router in web development is a mechanism where HTTP requests are routed to the code that handles them. To put simply, in the Router you determine what should happen when a user visits a certain page. Here is a simple routing example from Laravel.

## things iv learned

### things that have really started making this all come together is playing silly kids game like code combat and screep. at this point im very good at reading code and modifying code so it works just sometimes the syntax of writing it stumbles me up like i know what i want to do and hte logic behind it its just the actually executing it right.
### apis are starting to  make much more sense then they did during our 301 exam i just wish this class was alittle closer to when i finished 301 cuz its a little bit of relearning and also refreshing how it all goes togehter
### things im excited to learn about is how deep and crazy javascript can go and im sure there is 3 things in there that will all be exciting obviously coding is learning a new language and i know that the key to all of this is simple "repetition is the father of learning"
