# In Tests We Trust

## Unit tests and TDD?

* Unit tests are some pieces of code to exercise the input, the output and the behaviour of your code. You can write them anytime you want.

### The Cycle

* ðŸ†˜ Write a unit test and make it fail (it needs to fail because the feature isnâ€™t there, right? If this test passes, call the Ghostbusters, really)
* âœ… Write the feature and make the test pass! (you can dance after that)
* ðŸ”µ Refactor the code â€” the first version doesnâ€™t need to be the beautiful one (donâ€™t be shy)

## take aways

* The greatest advantage about TDD is to craft the software design first
* Your code will be more reliable: after a change you can run your tests and be in peace
* Beginning may be hard â€” and thatâ€™s fine. You just need to practice!

## Recursion

* The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion and the corresponding function is called as recursive function. Using recursive algorithm, certain problems can be solved quite easily.

* **What is base condition in recursion?**

* In the recursive program, the solution to the base case is provided and the solution of the bigger problem is expressed in terms of smaller problems. 

* **How a particular problem is solved using recursion?**

* The idea is to represent a problem in terms of one or more smaller problems, and add one or more base conditions that stop the recursion. 

## Modular programming

* is the process of breaking a large, unwieldy programming task into separate, smaller, more manageable subtasks or modules. Individual modules can then be put together like building blocks to create a larger application.
