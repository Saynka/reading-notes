## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. What is the benefit of transforming data into packets?

- Reliability and efficiency. It is easier to transfer small blocks data.

2. UDP is often refereed to as a connectionless protocol. Why is this?

- No connection needs to be established between the source and destination before you transmit data.

3. Can a socket server application have multiple socket connections?

- 65,536 sockets

4. Can a socket connection application be connected to multiple socket servers?

- nope

5. Can an application be both a socket server and a socket connection?

- yes

## Vocabulary

- Observer Pattern - is a software design pattern in which an object, named the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods.

- Listener - is a procedure in JavaScript that waits for an event to occur. The simple example of an event is a user clicking the mouse or pressing a key on the keyboard.

- Event Handler - can be used to handle and verify user input, user actions, and browser actions: Things that should be done every time a page loads. Things that should be done when the page is closed. Action that should be performed when a user clicks a button.

- Event Driven Programming - Everything starts by following an event. The event could be the DOM is loaded, or an asynchronous request that finishes fetching, or a user clicking an element or scrolling the page, or the user types on the keyboard.

- Event Loop - has one simple job â€” to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.

- Event Queue - a list of messages to be processed. Each message has an associated function which gets called in order to handle the message. At some point during the event loop, the runtime starts handling the messages on the queue, starting with the oldest one.

- Call Stack - is a stack data structure that stores information about the active subroutines of a computer program.

- Emit/Raise/Trigger - .on()/

- Subscribe - is an object that represents a disposable resource, usually the execution of an Observable

- database - is a data structure that stores organized information. Most databases contain multiple tables, which may each include several different fields. For example, a company database may include tables for products, employees, and financial records.

1. looking forward to bringing all these things together to build a real application or website!
