## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. Why is access control important?

- because it is a valuable security technique that can be used to regulate who or what can view or use any given resource. ... Without proper access control you could leave your staff and your company wide open to problems such as data loss, theft or breach of privacy and data protection laws.

2. Describe an application that would need access control.

- identification authentication and authorization of users and entities by evaluating required login credentials that can include passwords, personal identification numbers (PINs), biometric scans, security tokens or other authentication factors.

3. What is a role used for?

- are created for various job functions. The permissions to perform certain operations are assigned to specific roles.

4. Why is role based access control more scalable than discretionary or mandatory access control?

- Access Control - regulates which users, applications, and devices can view, edit, add, and delete resources in an organization’s environment. Controlling access is one of the key practices to protect sensitive data from theft, misuse, abuse, and any other threats. There are two levels of access control: physical and logical.

- Mandatory Access Control - (MAC) is a model of access control where the operating system provides users with access based on data confidentiality and user clearance levels. In this model, access is granted on a need to know basis: users have to prove a need for information before gaining access.

- MAC is considered the most secure of all access control models. Access rules are manually defined by system administrators and strictly enforced by the operating system or security kernel. Regular users can’t alter security attributes even for data they’ve created.
