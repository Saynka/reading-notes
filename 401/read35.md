## Reflection

- Ethics in tech seem like they dont really have a clear path or goal yet. there is stuff in these that is scary on a fundemental level. i dont know the right path that we should fallow but i feel that there needs to be something done to help filter all this insanity. the internet just exsists and theres no regulations or rules its just all of human knowledge, the good and more so the bad. i dont know the proper path to take in all this. but i dont think this problem will be solved in my life time if im being honest.
