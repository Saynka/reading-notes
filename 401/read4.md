## Terms

- functional programming - is a programming paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions. ... When a pure function is called with some given arguments, it will always return the same result, and cannot be affected by any mutable state or other side effects.

- object-oriented programming (OOP) - is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods).

- class - is an extensible program-code-template for creating objects, providing initial values for state (member variables) and implementations of behavior (member functions or methods). ... In these languages, a class that creates classes is called a metaclass

- super - The super keyword is used to access and call functions on an object's parent.

- this - In the global execution context (outside of any function), this refers to the global object whether in strict mode or not.

- Test Driven Development (TDD) - is the act of first deciding what you want your program to do 

- jest - is a delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity. It works with projects using: Babel, TypeScript, Node, React, Angular, Vue and more!

- Continuous Integration (CI) - is the practice of merging all developers' working copies to a shared mainline several times a day.

- rest - parameter syntax allows a function to accept an indefinite number of arguments as an array, providing a way to represent variadic functions in JavaScript.

- Data Mode -  is an abstract model that organizes elements of data and standardizes how they relate to one another and to the properties of real-world entities.

## Review Reasearch and Discussion 

1. 3 advantages to Test drvin Development
* Better program design and higher code quality.
* Detailed project documentation.
* Save project costs in the long run.
2. what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?
* beforeEach and afterEach are run before/after every it block in the current context and all nested contexts. so in what case you need you use this would be what ever the situation calls for to test your it block maybe console.logs just to see if what your trying to get somewhere
3. What is one downside of Test Driven Development
* Like any programming, there is a big difference between doing it and doing it well.  Writing good unit tests is an art form. This aspect of TDD is often not discussed, many managers tend to focus on metrics like code coverage; those metrics tell you nothing about the quality of the unit tests.
* Unit testing is something the whole team has to buy into.
* Hard to apply to existing legacy code.
4. Whatâ€™s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?
* ES6 - A child of an ES6 class is another type definition which extends the parent with new properties and methods, which in turn can be instantiated at runtime.
* Prototype - A child of a prototype is another object instance which delegates to the parent any properties that aren't implemented on the child.
5. Why REST?
* REST API is a way of easily accessing web services without having excess processing. Whenever a RESTful API is called, the server will transfer to the client a representation of the state of the requested resource.

## Review

1. Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?
* test driven development seems like the most logical way to write code honestly its like writing a recipe and then using the tools to make said recipe and thats like "big brain time"
2. Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?
* modularization of projects! this is how my brain works so this makes more sense to me then everything on its own page
* mongoose and mangodb they seem pretty cool and fun to use 
* jest, i want to know how this works 100% so i can test everything all the time see things working
3. What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?
* modularization of projects
* Test drivin development
