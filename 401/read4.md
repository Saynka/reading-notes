## Terms

- functional programming - is a programming paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions. ... When a pure function is called with some given arguments, it will always return the same result, and cannot be affected by any mutable state or other side effects.

- object-oriented programming (OOP) - is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods).

- class - is an extensible program-code-template for creating objects, providing initial values for state (member variables) and implementations of behavior (member functions or methods). ... In these languages, a class that creates classes is called a metaclass

- super - The super keyword is used to access and call functions on an object's parent.

- this - In the global execution context (outside of any function), this refers to the global object whether in strict mode or not.

- Test Driven Development (TDD) - is the act of first deciding what you want your program to do
