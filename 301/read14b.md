# Project Ideas & APIs

## https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis

* taking my 201 project that was like a harry potter type game and remaking it to look kinda like the old school pokemon layouts. but on more thought that seems like it couldny work cuz i dont know how apis would play into that?

* second idea is a collector type thing? like magic card collector where you look threw a data base of cards and see what ones you have and have them saved locally to the app so you know where you can add or delete them?

* third idea would be maybe along the same lines but do like a gear tracker? for maybe like monster hunter or wow or somekinda hting where same kinda concept you choose what stuff you have and it saves it and you can scroll threw lists to pick out things you want or maybe look something up that you want?
