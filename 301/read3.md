# Flexbox and Templating

Javascript Templating
Javascript templating is a fast and efficient technique to render client-side view templates with Javascript by using a JSON data source. The template is HTML markup, with added templating tags that will either insert variables or run programming logic.
The template engine then replaces variables and instances declared in a template file with actual values at runtime, and convert the template into an HTML file sent to the client.

Mustache is a logic-less template syntax. It can be used for HTML, config files, source code — anything. It works by expanding tags in a template using values provided in a hash or object.

## FLEX BOX

flex-start (default): items are packed toward the start of the flex-direction.
flex-end: items are packed toward the end of the flex-direction.
start: items are packed toward the start of the writing-mode direction.
end: items are packed toward the end of the writing-mode direction.
left: items are packed toward left edge of the container, unless that doesn’t make sense with the flex-direction, then it behaves like start.
right: items are packed toward right edge of the container, unless that doesn’t make sense with the flex-direction, then it behaves like start.
center: items are centered along the line
space-between: items are evenly distributed in the line; first item is on the start line, last item on the end line
space-around: items are evenly distributed in the line with equal space around them. Note that visually the spaces aren’t equal, since all the items have equal space on both sides. The first item will have one unit of space against the container edge, but two units of space between the next item because that next item has its own spacing that applies.
space-evenly: items are distributed so that the spacing between any two items (and the space to the edges) is equal.
