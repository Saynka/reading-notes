# Pair Programming

pair programmimng is obviously the most logical way to be effecient in coding. unless you are actually one of those autistic in a good way math genious problem solver and know your stuff really well.

basically its saying that while you could argue its a wast of resources in the short run to have 2 people working on the same project.
you could also argue that those two people are more likely to save time in the long run because those 2 people are not only gonna write code that works but also 2 minds are better then one so you are less likely to have major problems that do in fact take up alot of time and resources to fix. im sure there is circumstances where you would have to weigh both of these options and proceed accordingly.

css-style selecters 

 **$('li.hot')**

jquery() function has one parameter: a css-style selector. This selecter find all of the <li> elements with a class of hot.

* they share similarities to doms 

you can store the j query object in a varable, just as you can with dom nodes

you can minpulate the dom nodes that you select

* key differences from dom

its cross-browser and theres no need to write fallback code.

its more accurate because it uses css style syntaxx

once you have made a selection, you can apply multiple methods to it.

jQuery script tags go on the bottom of your page? before the closing <body tag 

the whole purpose of this language is to make JavaScript more simple. this is like the short hand
"write less, do more"

main things its used for are

* loop threw elements 
* add/ remove elements from the DOM tree
* Handle events
* fade elements into/ out of view 
* handle ajax requests "no idea what ajax means"

second part of reading still dosent make much sense after reading it 2 times i woul dneed to see it in a relevent situation to what im working on or go make something relevent
looping 
chaining make sense
