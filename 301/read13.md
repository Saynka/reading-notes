# Sending form data

* Once the form data has been validated on the client-side, it is okay to submit the form. And, since we covered validation in the previous article, we're ready to submit! This article looks at what happens when a user submits a form — where does the data go, and how do we handle it when it gets there? We also look at some of the security concerns associated with sending form data.

## Client/server architecture

* At it's most basic, the web uses a client/server architecture that can be summarized as follows. a client (usually a web browser) sends a request to a server (most of the time a web server like Apache, Nginx, IIS, Tomcat, etc.), using the HTTP protocol. The server answers the request using the same protocol.

* An HTML form on a web page is nothing more than a convenient user-friendly way to configure an HTTP request to send data to a server. This enables the user to provide information to be delivered in the HTTP request.

## On the client side: defining how to send the data

* The <form> element defines how the data will be sent. All of its attributes are designed to let you configure the request to be sent when a user hits a submit button. The two most important attributes are action and method.

## The action attribute

 * The action attribute defines where the data gets sent. Its value must be a valid relative or absolute URL. If this attribute isn't provided, the data will be sent to the URL of the page containing the form — the current page.

## The method attribute

* The method attribute defines how data is sent. The HTTP protocol provides several ways to perform a request; HTML form data can be transmitted via a number of different methods, the most common being the GET method and the POST method

* To understand the difference between those two methods, let's step back and examine how HTTP works. Each time you want to reach a resource on the Web, the browser sends a request to a URL. An HTTP request consists of two parts: a header that contains a set of global metadata about the browser's capabilities, and a body that can contain information necessary for the server to process the specific request.

## The GET method

* The GET method is the method used by the browser to ask the server to send back a given resource: "Hey server, I want to get this resource." In this case, the browser sends an empty body. Because the body is empty, if a form is sent using this method the data sent to the server is appended to the URL.

## The POST method

* The POST method is a little different. It's the method the browser uses to talk to the server when asking for a response that takes into account the data provided in the body of the HTTP request: "Hey server, take a look at this data and send me back an appropriate result." If a form is sent using this method, the data is appended to the body of the HTTP request.

## On the server side: retrieving the data

Whichever HTTP method you choose, the server receives a string that will be parsed in order to get the data as a list of key/value pairs. The way you access this list depends on the development platform you use and on any specific frameworks you may be using with it.

## A special case: sending files

* Sending files with HTML forms is a special case. Files are binary data — or considered as such — whereas all other data is text data. Because HTTP is a text protocol, there are special requirements for handling binary data.

## Security issues

* Each time you send data to a server, you need to consider security. HTML forms are by far the most common server attack vectors (places where attacks can occur). The problems never come from the HTML forms themselves — they come from how the server handles data.

The Website security article of our server-side learning topic discusses a number of common attacks and potential defences against them in detail. You should go and check that article out, to get an idea of what's possible.

## Summary

* As we'd alluded to above, sending form data is easy, but securing an application can be tricky. Just remember that a front-end developer is not the one who should define the security model of the data.It's possible to perform client-side form validation, but the server can't trust this validation because it has no way to truly know what has really happened on the client-side.

If you've worked your way through these tutorials in order, you now know how to markup and style a form, do client-side validation, and have some idea about submitting a form.
